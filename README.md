Paracesis is a simple server setup menu to make creating a server
much more easy. The app is in very early development and features will be added periodically.

Automatic server configurations include: SSH, FTP, and VNC. I plan to update the app to make it even 
easier to setup a server. Feel free to redistribute app and share on social media!

To install on linux:
  sudo apt update |
  sudo apt install git |
  sudo apt install python3 |
  git clone https://github.com/Tony-Finn/Paracesis.git |
  cd Paracesis |
  sudo python3 paracesis.py

If you have any issues, try running the bash script with the following command: 
  cd Paracesis |
  sudo bash fix.sh
